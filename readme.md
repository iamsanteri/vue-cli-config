This is a vue-cli configuration to be used when building a "dist" for an existing website. Put this file into the app root folder and run "npm run build". Proceed to integrating into a current platform. Please not to use as little local assets as possible and rather host the static files on something like AWS S3.

After file has been added to the project root, continue to build towards a standard build target by the Vue CLI (more info in Docs).
